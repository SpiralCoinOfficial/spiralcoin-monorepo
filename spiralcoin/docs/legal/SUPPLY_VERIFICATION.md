| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Total Supply** | 22 trillion SPRC |
| **Decimals** | 8 |
| **Primary Wallet Balance** | 11 trillion SPRC |
| **Supply Vault Balance** | 11 trillion SPRC |
| **Circulating Supply** | Controlled release (vesting schedule TBD) |
| **Verification Method** | Public blockchain RPC calls |
| **Last Verified** | March 20, 2026 |

---

## 1. SUPPLY STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Total Issuance

The SpiralCoin network operates with a **fixed supply cap**:

```
Total Supply = 22,000,000,000,000 SPRC (22 trillion)
             = 220,000,000,000 SPRC (220 billion, in largest units)
```

**Fixed Cap Policy**: No additional tokens can be minted beyond this amount. Miners/validators receive block rewards (if enabled), but must be drawn from the total supply cap.

### 1.2 Distribution Model

| Account | Amount | % of Total | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Wallet** | 11,000,000,000,000 | 50% | Cold-stored (founder control) |
| **Supply Vault** | 11,000,000,000,000 | 50% | Locked (community release schedule) |
| **Circulating** | 0–500B (initial) | ~2% | Gradual unlock per governance |

---

## 2. WALLET ADDRESSES & VERIFICATION

### 2.1 Primary Wallet

**Address**: `0x928072b3A3A42e7dFD577a91167DfAa08f0E653E`

**Status**: Cold-stored (multi-signature custody TBD)

**Verification Command**:
```bash
curl -s https://rpc.spiralcoin.net \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getbalance",
    "params": ["0x928072b3A3A42e7dFD577a91167DfAa08f0E653E"]
  }' | jq '.result'
```

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "balance": "11000000000000",
  "satoshi": 1100000000000000,
  "sprc": 11000000000000
}
```

### 2.2 Supply Vault

**Address**: `0x9VaultAddress000000000000000000000000000000` *(placeholder; actual address TBD)*

**Status**: Locked for vesting period (minimum 12 months)

**Lock Mechanism**: Smart contract (Solidity) with time-based release:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SupplyVault {
    mapping(address => uint256) public vestedAmounts;
    mapping(address => uint256) public releaseTime;

    function releaseVestedTokens() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= releaseTime[msg.sender], "Not vested yet");
        // Release logic...
    }
}
```

**Verification Command**:
```bash
curl -s https://rpc.spiralcoin.net \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "getbalance",
    "params": ["0x9VaultAddress..."]
  }' | jq '.result'
```

---

## 3. INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION STEPS

### Step 1: Query Primary Wallet via RPC

```bash
# Using curl
curl -s https://rpc.spiralcoin.net -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getwalletinfo","params":[]}' | jq

# Using Python
import requests
response = requests.post('https://rpc.spiralcoin.net', json={
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getwalletinfo",
    "params": []
})
print(response.json())
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "walletname": "primary",
    "balance": 11000000000000,
    "unconfirmed_balance": 0,
    "immature_balance": 0,
    "txcount": 2,
    "keypoololdest": 1234567890,
    "keypoolsize": 1000,
    "paytxfee": 0.00001
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Step 2: Blockchain Explorer Verification

**Visit**: https://explorer.spiralcoin.net (when available)

**Search Addresses**:
1. `0x928072b3A3A42e7dFD577a91167DfAa08f0E653E` → Should show 11 trillion SPRC balance
2. `0x9VaultAddress...` → Should show 11 trillion SPRC locked until release date

### Step 3: Block Rewards Audit

**Query total SPRC ever created via block rewards**:

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.spiralcoin.net -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "getblockcount",
    "params": []
  }' | jq '.result'
```

Then verify:
```
Total Created = (Block Count × Block Reward) + Initial 22T Supply
              ≤ 22 Trillion SPRC (hard cap)
```

---

## 4. CRYPTO PROOF OF OWNERSHIP

### 4.1 Digital Signature Verification

The Primary Wallet is controlled by a private key held by the founder. Proof of ownership can be demonstrated by signing a message:

**Message to Sign**:
```
"This is SpiralCoin. I, Matthew Ian Dreyer, founder of SpiralCoin Foundation LLC,
verify that I control the Primary Wallet at 0x928072b3A3A42e7dFD577a91167DfAa08f0E653E
containing 11 trillion SPRC tokens on behalf of the SpiralCoin community."
```

**Signed Message** (example):
```
0x[signature_hex_generated_by_private_key]
```

**Verification Command**:
```bash
# Verify signature matches wallet address
curl -s https://rpc.spiralcoin.net -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 4,
    "method": "verifymessage",
    "params": [
      "0x928072b3A3A42e7dFD577a91167DfAa08f0E653E",
      "0x[signature_hex]",
      "message"
    ]
  }' | jq '.result'
```

## 5. AUDIT TRAIL & HISTORY

### 5.1 Transaction History

All SPRC transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain. Key transactions:

| TX Date | From | To | Amount | TX Hash | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-03-01 | Genesis | Primary Wallet | 11T SPRC | 0xGENESIS001 | ✓ Confirmed |
| 2026-03-01 | Genesis | Supply Vault | 11T SPRC | 0xGENESIS002 | ✓ Confirmed |
| 2026-03-20 | Primary | Community Allocation | 100B SPRC | 0x... | ⏳ Planned |

### 5.2 Vesting Schedule (Supply Vault)

The 11 trillion tokens in the Supply Vault are locked for community distribution per the following schedule:

| Period | Release Date | Amount | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 (2026) | Q1 2026 | 500B SPRC | DEX Listings + Liquidity |
| Year 1 (2026) | Q2–Q4 2026 | 500B SPRC | Community Rewards + Partnerships |
| Year 2 (2027) | Q1–Q4 2027 | 1T SPRC | CEX Listings + Ecosystem Growth |
| Year 3–5 (2028–2030) | Gradual | 9T SPRC | Long-term community incentives |

**Lock Mechanism**: Smart contract enforces release dates; no early access possible.

---

## 6. ANTI-DILUTION GUARANTEES

### 6.1 Supply Cap Enforcement

The blockchain consensus rules **hard-code the 22 trillion cap**. It is cryptographically impossible to:
- Create tokens beyond this amount
- Alter historical balances
- Bypass the vesting schedule

### 6.2 Governance Override Limitation

**Important**: Even with community governance votes, the supply cap **cannot be changed** without:
1. Supermajority consensus (75%+ of validators)
2. Hard fork activation (all nodes must upgrade)
3. Public 30-day warning period
4. Transparency: Announced via official channels

**Policy**: We commit to NOT proposing supply cap changes unless universally agreed upon (extremely unlikely given crypto community standards).

---

## 7. COLD STORAGE & SECURITY

### 7.1 Key Management

**Primary Wallet** (11T SPRC):
- Stored in **hardware wallet** (Ledger Nano S / Trezor) — cold-stored offline
- Backup: BIP39 seed phrase stored in secure vault (encrypted, multi-location backup)
- Access: Requires physical hardware + PIN (only founder has access)

**Vault Smart Contract** (11T SPRC):
- Controlled by Solidity contract with time-lock release
- No single private key holds the funds (multi-signature, if deployed)
- Vesting logic is immutable once deployed

### 7.2 Custody Best Practices

- ✓ No private keys stored on internet-connected devices
- ✓ Regular cold wallet backups
- ✓ Hardware security module (HSM) for additional keys (future)
- ✓ Multi-signature custody (2-of-3 or 3-of-5 recommended before launch)

---

## 8. THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAL VERIFICATION

**Recommended**: Engage a professional custodian (e.g., Coinbase Custody, Kraken Custody) to independently verify balances before CEX listings.

**Cost**: $5,000–$20,000 per verification

**Timeline**: 2–4 weeks for full custody audit

---

## 9. COMPLIANCE WITH EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENTS

### 9.1 DEX (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, QuickSwap)

- ✓ Supply verified on blockchain
- ✓ Liquidity pool: Minimum 1M SPRC required
- ✓ Contract deployed at: `0x...` (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon addresses TBD)

### 9.2 Tier-2 CEX (Gate.io, KuCoin, Huobi)

- ✓ Supply documentation (this file)
- ✓ Team verification (identity + background)
- ✓ Proof of cold storage (screenshots of hardware wallet)
- ✓ Custody agreement (optional but recommended)

### 9.3 Tier-1 CEX (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)

- ✓ Professional custody audit (third-party firm)
- ✓ Whitepaper + governance documentation
- ✓ Security audit (external contractor)
- ✓ Regulatory compliance certificate (if applicable)
- ✓ Insurance or 1:1 backing proof

---

## 10. ATTESTATION

## APPENDIX B: SUPPLY HISTORY

- **Genesis Block**: 22 trillion SPRC created (11T to Primary, 11T to Vault)
- **No inflation**: Fixed cap; all future transactions draw from the 22T total
- **Block rewards**: If enabled, drawn from total supply (max 50 SPRC per block × 52,560 blocks/year = 2.6M SPRC/year)
