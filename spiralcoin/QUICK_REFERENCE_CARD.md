## 🔧 COMMON ISSUES

### Service Crashed?
```bash
/root/status.sh                    # See what's down
docker compose logs backend | tail -20  # Why it crashed
docker compose restart             # Restart
/root/status.sh                    # Verify recovery
```

### Disk Full?
```bash
df -h                              # Check %
docker system prune -a             # Clean docker
find /var/log -name "*.log" -delete  # Clean logs
```

### Slow/Unresponsive?
```bash
top                                # Check CPU/memory
docker compose logs -f             # Watch logs for errors
docker compose restart             # Restart services
```

### Need to Restore?
```bash
ls /root/spiralcoin-backups/              # List backups
docker compose down                       # Stop services
tar -xzf /root/spiralcoin-backups/BACKUP.tar.gz -C /  # Restore
docker compose up -d                      # Start services
/root/status.sh                           # Verify
```
