## 🚀 YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Today)

### Action 1: Enable Automated Backups & Monitoring (30 seconds)

Run this **once** on the production server:

```bash
ssh root@174.138.37.6

# Option A: Direct execution (simplest)
bash < <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiralCoinOfficial/spiralcoin/main/scripts/setup-automation.sh)

# Option B: Manual download
cd /root
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiralCoinOfficial/spiralcoin/main/scripts/setup-automation.sh
bash setup-automation.sh
```

**What this does**:
- ✅ Creates backup script (runs daily at 2 AM)
- ✅ Creates monitoring script (runs every 5 min)
- ✅ Sets up security updates (weekly)
- ✅ Installs all cron jobs
- ✅ Creates status dashboard (`/root/status.sh`)

**Verification**:
```bash
/root/status.sh                     # Shows full dashboard
crontab -l                          # Shows scheduled jobs
tail -5 /var/log/spiralcoin-backup.log   # Shows backup status
```

---

### Action 2: Update DNS Records (5 minutes)

**Your domain**: spiralcoin.net
**Your server IP**: 174.138.37.6

**Steps** (example shown for GoDaddy - see DNS_CONFIGURATION.md for other registrars):

```
1. Login to domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add/Edit "A" record:
   Name: @
   Type: A
   Value: 174.138.37.6
   TTL: 3600 (or 1 hour)
4. Add/Edit "CNAME" record:
   Name: www
   Type: CNAME
   Value: spiralcoin.net
   TTL: 3600
5. Save changes
6. Wait 15 minutes to 48 hours for propagation
```

**Verify DNS is live**:
```bash
nslookup spiralcoin.net
dig spiralcoin.net
# Or: https://www.whatsmydns.net/?q=spiralcoin.net
```

Once DNS is live, access:
- 🌐 https://spiralcoin.net (Web UI)
- 📊 https://spiralcoin.net:5000 (Backend API)
- ⛓️ https://spiralcoin.net:8545 (RPC Daemon)
- 📡 https://spiralcoin.net:4000 (MarketFeed)

---

### Action 3: Set Up External Monitoring (10 minutes)

Automatic alerts if your platform goes down:

```
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com
2. Sign up (free account)
3. Create monitor:
   - URL: https://spiralcoin.net
   - Check every: 5 minutes
4. Set alerts:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Discord: your-server (optional)
5. Add more monitors for each service
```

**Result**: You get email/Discord alerts if anything goes down.

See [EXTERNAL_MONITORING.md](EXTERNAL_MONITORING.md) for step-by-step guide.
